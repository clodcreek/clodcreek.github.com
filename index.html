    <p>I heard of blogs before but I have never thought of starting my own. I used to write loads of diaries which are now hidden underneath my bed in a wooden basket. Once in a while, I read parts of them. I love how they bring me back to certain situations. Most of the time, I am able to recapture a particular moment.</p>
    <p>During these past years, I have gradually stopped writing diaries. I was too busy running around and did not take the time to sit down and think about what is going on and happening to me. </p>
    <p>At this very moment, I feel that my life will change in a very profound way. Imagine, I have never really stopped and thought about what I want to do with my life, who I am and worst of all, I cannot say that I love and accept the person I am. Now, I just turned 30 and it seems that I have the crisis of my life. My current job ended in a burn out, I am sick of working for people who do not appreciate what I do, who are disrespectful and ignorant. I am kind of disenchanted with life but I want to get my happiness back which I lost somewhere during my childhood. And now is the time. </p>
    <p>I was always mad at me and my parents that I never took and got the chance to find out where I want to go, to get out of the country and see the world, experience another language and culture for a year or longer. Well, I am still in my home country but I do not have to work at my current job right now because I am not able to. Now, I am actually having time to try things, to think about myself, to learn to accept myself and to start to enjoy life again. My tool for self-reflection will be this blog and your comments and thoughts are welcome (if I somehow figure out how you can leave your comments).</p>
    <p>Well, I guess this is enough for today. Let's see what will happen tomorrow.</p>
